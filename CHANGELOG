# jQuery Plugin Template Changelog

## v.09
- Made the plugin extensable (OO)
- Added the instance to the elements themselves; accessable via `el.data("_plugin_")`
- Changed usage from a single element to many
- Avoiding the `$` function all together lest there be conflicts w/ other - better libraries.
- Added Support for `Events`.

## v.08
- We've removed `returnjQuery` and `_return()` since they’re annoying
- You can access the jQuery object at `$this.element`
- `init()` is private since it should only be ran once
- Currently we only use the first element if you have a collection when calling `$()._plugin_();` we will add better support in a later version
- Added some events and event functions by default
